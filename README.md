# Description
This browser extension allows you to convert any chosen currency to multiple other currencies simultaneously, saving you time when you need exchange rates for several currencies at once.

# Features
* **🔄 Bulk currency conversion:** Convert your base currency to multiple target currencies in one operation.
* **💱 Supports Major Currencies:** Including USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, AUD, CAD, and many more (169 Total Currencies).

* **⌨️ Keyboard Navigation:** Fully accessible with keyboard shortcuts and tab navigation.
  * Fully navigable via keyboard (Tab, Arrow keys, Enter, Esc).
  * Jump quickly to currency names by pressing the first letter of the currency (e.g. pressing U jumps to UAH).

* **🧲 Drag & Drop Organization:** Easily reorder your target currencies by dragging them into your preferred order.
* **🌗 Dark Mode:** Seamlessly switch between light and dark themes with a simple toggle for a comfortable viewing experience.
* **🔒 Private & Secure:** Your data stays on your device; no tracking or analytics.
* **📡 Offline Support:** Converts using the cached exchange rates when you're offline or disconnected.
* **🪙 Convert on Select:** Instantly convert selected text from any webpage with a simple click.
* **✨ Smart Currency Detection:**  Automatically detects the currency format on a webpage (example: 100USD, 100 USD, 100$, 100 $, and many other variants!)
